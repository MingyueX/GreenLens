<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project â„¹
<!--
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
-->
Forest inventories serve as a foundation for forest planning and management, are key to understanding carbon sequestration dynamics, and are an essential basis for forest ecology research. Such an inventory is, essentially, the recording of certain parameters for each tree in a forest plot; these include location, height, and trunk diameter, typically at breast height (DBH).

An ideal approach to forest inventory should be available worldwide for mass adoption, require minimal capital expenditure and training, rapidly acquire data, and have a low error rate even in challenging field conditions. We believe we have achieved the above goals. Our solution uses ARCore, which is available on a wide variety of low-end smartphones, making it suitable for worldwide mass adoption. The user experience has been carefully designed to require minimal training and allow rapid data acquisition.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started ðŸ”°

If you would like to try our app, please download our [APK](https://apkpure.com/p/com.cleeg.greenlens) from APKPure and install it on your Android phone. Before using the app, we strongly recommend checking [Support Device](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices) to ensure device compatibility.

If you are a developer or an ecological researcher interested in understanding how the app operates in depth, you can refer to the following guidelines to run the app. However, before doing so, we still recommend that you review [our paper](https://www.cambridge.org/engage/coe/article-details/657491c25bc9fcb5c9727f79) to understand the app's architecture, image processing pipeline, and diameter estimation methodology.
