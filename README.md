<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project â„¹
<!--
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
-->
Forest inventories serve as a foundation for forest planning and management, are key to understanding carbon sequestration dynamics, and are an essential basis for forest ecology research. Such an inventory is, essentially, the recording of certain parameters for each tree in a forest plot; these include location, height, and trunk diameter, typically at breast height (DBH).

An ideal approach to forest inventory should be available worldwide for mass adoption, require minimal capital expenditure and training, rapidly acquire data, and have a low error rate even in challenging field conditions. We believe we have achieved the above goals. Our solution uses ARCore, which is available on a wide variety of low-end smartphones, making it suitable for worldwide mass adoption. The user experience has been carefully designed to require minimal training and allow rapid data acquisition.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started ðŸ”°

If you would like to try our app, please download our [APK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17-Yu3KXcgJiFapGc2AjJ2dHNC30YUbup) from Google Drive and install it on your Android phone (see [Installation Tutorial](howtoinstall.md)). Before using the app, we strongly recommend checking [Support Device](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices) to ensure device compatibility.

If you are a developer or an ecological researcher interested in understanding how the app operates in depth, you can clone this repository and open it in a IDE like Android Studio. This also allows you to customize some functionalities. However, before doing so, we recommend that you review [our paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954124003169?ssrnid=4786687&dgcid=SSRN_redirect_SD) to understand the app's implementation details, image processing pipeline, and diameter estimation methodology.
### Prerequisites ðŸ”‘

We recommend ARCore version >1.18.

### Quick Installation âš’

* Download the APK and install it on your Android device
* Open the app and wait patiently, the app will automatically download some dependencies, so this may take a while.
* Complete the registration and you're ready to start!
